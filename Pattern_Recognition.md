<h3>Introduction</h3>
Design patterns are choices made in the coding process by the developer in order to make code easier to maintain or control.

Eventually, I looked away from the video game area for a little bit and took a look into cyber security. I joined a GenCyber Hawaii camp for a summer and graduated. Whilst there, I was engrossed in the idea of being a hacker. To break in to someone else's computer? How dangerous and fun the whole thing was! Even though I was not the best, my mindset changed to finding out which one was actually for me. The strategy and fun of game design, or the competitive and brain turning cyber security field.
<h3>Future Outlook</h3>
Currently, I do not know where my interests lead me to wanting to be, but I do know that I love coding and figuring out solutions to things. I want to be able to learn how to work together with peers to complete a coding project, because most of the time I feel most at peace when I work by myself and my own thoughts. I want to experience what it is like to work on a massive project or to have free reign over coding something. I want to experience other languages and compare them with each other. Maybe even sometime along there, I would want to teach the younger generation coding! Well... one can hope for the future, but it'll be up to me to make it happen.
