UI Frameworks are like learning a whole other language. Even while looking throughout the documentation of a framework like Bootstrrap 5, there was so much to learn in of itself. Obviously, the main purpose of UI frameworks is to reduce the overall work. However, it does take a long time to learn about all the new shortcuts. Specifically talking about my experience with Bootstrap 5, I can see how it makes it so much easier to format HTML and CSS without as much extensive and complicated code. Still, learning all the code, if not for walkthrough videos or Youtube, I would not know how to format it myself.
<h3>Bootstrap 5</h3>
Whilst copying websites using Bootstrap 5, there were a lot of things that if I looked at it through the eyes of just basic HTML and CSS, I would spend a whole day trying to figure out. With Bootstrap 5, I was able to easily format a navigation bar, footers, etc. However, if not for videos on what to look for or use while formating with Bootstrap 5, I feel like I still might spend a good hour working on one thing. Personally, I would never have known to use so many divs instead of basic img or p tags. But in the end, if you know what you're writing, like letters in the alphabet, it becomes much easier to navigate.

<h3>Other UI Frameworks</h3>
As for experience in other frameworks, I have none. However, if other UI frameworks are similar to Bootstrap, there are what feels like a limited amount of customization to format to a specificality. Learning the framework itself would take a while to learn, increasing the speed of completion of code. Once learned, however, can become a good tool to use. The limited customability also can provide consistency in the same way.
