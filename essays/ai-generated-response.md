<h3>Introduction</h3>
AI-generated content is used for a wide range of things, and in education, students use it to complete their homework or to answer a question they cannot figure out themselves. AI has the purpose of providing people with easy access to information on topics of their choice in the blink of an eye. In a specific field like software engineering, it is very useful for completing code and can generate ready-to-use code for projects.
<h2>Personal Experience with AI</h2>
Within the class of ICS 314, I have used AI for a multitude of tasks, like generating ideas, finding errors, and overall cleaning up code. Specifically, I only used ChatGPT for this class.
<h3>Experience WOD's</h3>
Experienced WODs are often simple to do once you understand exactly what the task wants you to do. For the experience of WODs that have picture references, they were often easy enough to not need to use ChatGPT. If they did not have pictures, I still did not use any generative AI because I thought of it as a challenge.
<h3>In-Class Practice WODs</h3>
During the practice WODs in class, I did not use any generative AI. This is because I would often consult with my group mates on any problems I had and resolve them that way by comparing codes.
<h3>Experience WOD's</h3>
WODs are the bane of my existence. Although there were so many WODs, I have only used ChatGPT once, and that was to find out how to properly code an image in JavaScript. Due to my struggles with using javascript, I asked specifically how to add an image to the background of a javascript file, and ChatGPT provided me with about 4 different options. In the end, it ended up being not very useful because I could not get it to work in time, and it was tough knowing which solution to use.
<h3>Essays</h3>
In writing essays, I did not use AI simply because it does not appeal to me to use AI in writing unless I am on a time crunch. I would want to know what I am talking about, especially if it is about personal experience.
<h3>Final Project</h3>
So far, there has been no use of any sort of AI in the entire project. In the future, however, there may be some use when we have an issue that we are unable to resolve ourselves.
<h3>Discord/Smart Questions/Coding Examples/Concpets/Tutorials</h3>
Throughout the entire discord, I had not used AI because I never answered, talked much, or tried to answer any questions. Specifically, I looked through the questions for any I might have had, and they had all been answered by the time I went through them. Although I did not use AI for coding examples, I should have done so to better understand the topics I had struggled with.
<h3>Explaining, Writing, Quality Assurance, and Documenting Code</h3>
For the purpose of explaining, writing, and documenting code, I did not use ChatGPT for this. Due to how large most of the code I worked with is, it became increasingly difficult to pinpoint specifically which part of the code was the problem, and copying and pasting the code into ChatGPT simply did not work.
<h3>Other uses in ICS 314 Not Listed</h3>
I did not use ChatGPT for other uses in ICS 314 that were not listed. ChatGPT was mainly used to look up solutions to problems I did not understand how to solve.
<h3>Impact on Learning and Understanding</h3>
Concerning my learning experience, the use of ChatGPT helped my understanding of some of the content I did not understand. In terms of developing my skills in the topic, it helped because I now know what ways I can potentially use to solve the problem if it ever comes up again. Overall, I think AI technology enhances my understanding of software engineering topics.
<h3>Practical Applications</h3>
Outside of ICS 314, the use of AI can be used for business ideas, projects, or common solutions to real-world problems. In the real world, AI can be useful for basically anything. If you need to get a speech script done, type it into AI. If you need ideas on how to job search, ask AI.
<h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
The limitations of the use of AI in this course are that it cannot read all of the context that we know as students. For example, we know that we have to use React Bootstrap if we have a specific object in another file. AI tends to give more general answers rather than specific ones.
<h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
Traditional teaching methods and AI options have their strengths and weaknesses. In terms of engagement, traditional teaching methods allow face-to-face interactions, meaning a more hands-on approach to activities, but students may not like this teaching style and may find it tiring. AI options may offer interactive simulations or virtual labs, but they miss out on face-to-face interactions. Knowledge retention through traditional methods means personal one-on-one interaction and physical materials, whereas AI, although it can sometimes analyze individuals, tends to generalize and therefore may lack the option to personalize learning. Practical skills are better developed through a hands-on approach and a literal real-world application rather than virtual labs.
<h3>Future Considerations</h3>
I believe that AI will eventually get better at learning specific details about people and personalizing answers better for everyone individually. In software engineering, I believe that eventually AI will be able to work side by side with developers to make coding easier to develop. Of course, if AI uses the same security type for everyone's code, maybe we should make our own instead of relying on AI...
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
To sum up, AI is a valuable tool to use for programmers and non-programmers alike. Through the use of ChatGPT in ICS 314, I was able to find solutions to specific errors and problems in my code faster, as well as get general ideas on how to do things. While AI does tend to generalize answers, it becomes useful when all you need is an idea of how a solution might be started. Specifying more in a question to AI gets more specific answers, but it should be used in moderation, as not all the answers are going to lead to the answer.
