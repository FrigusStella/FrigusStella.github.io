  <h3>What are Coding Standards?</h3>
<p>Coding standards in software development are a set of guidelines for a specific language. It gives a uniform appearance when coding in any specific language. In a way, it could be just very minute details like how many spaces you put while indenting lines or where you add the closing bracket. However, using coding standards specifically for a certain language can be beneficial for learning it. Simply put, by attributing to your memory a specific way of typing things, it can help you remember it easier, especially if you are learning multiple languages. Also, in a setting where you are learning the language among other people, having everyone’s code in the same format is one, easier on the eyes of the grader, and two, easier to spot differences and possible mistakes.</p>
<h3>ESLint</h3>
<p>After going through a week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I can say for sure that it is extremely helpful. I like the formatting style and how it makes me format specifics. It tells me things like what I can change or what I haven’t used yet, which in itself is extremely helpful in coding. There is a satisfying feeling after getting rid of all the yellow underlines and all the errors and finally seeing the green check mark, basically saying the code looks as good as it can get.</p>
<h3>Wrap up</h3>
<p>In general, I think coding standards should be used by everyone, as at the very least they tell you what might be missing parentheses or semicolons. Although I think that there should be one coding standard for every individual language, I think that it might be more uniform if everyone using a language matches a specific format. Maybe people like using a personal format because it is what they’re used to, but it would be helpful if, for example, you write code for a job and someone new gets hired. If they have experience in the language, they would understand the code easier, and it would be easier for them to look at compared to if there wasn’t only one coding standard for the language. Well, as long as it works in the end, I guess.</p>
