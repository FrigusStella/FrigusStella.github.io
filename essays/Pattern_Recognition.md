<h3>Introduction</h3>
If you are like me, you may be wondering what the heck design patterns are in coding. Personally, I never knew that I had been partaking in any specific design choice, but I was! Design patterns in coding are easily replicated solutions to common problems found in coding. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers and architects. These patterns provide general solutions to recurring issues, offering a structured way to design and organize code. By utilizing these design tactics, design patterns promote a more manigable and easily maintained code in software development.
<h3>Examples of Design Patterns</h3>
In JavaScript and HTML, design patterns refer to coding in the context of web development. In JavaScript, a popular design pattern is the Module pattern, which encases private and public members within a single module, enhancing code organization and reducing namespace pollution. Another notable pattern is the Observer pattern, often used in event handling, where an object maintains a list of its dependents that are notified of state changes. In HTML, design patterns are often associated with structuring and styling web pages. The Model-View-Controller pattern is commonly applied, separating concerns between data, user interface, and application logic. Additionally, the Component pattern is prevalent in the creation of reusable and encapsulated UI elements. These design patterns contribute to more maintainable, scalable, and efficient JavaScript and HTML codebases by providing structured solutions to common challenges in web development.
<h3>Evolution of Design Patterns</h3>
Over the years, design patterns have evolved and adapted in response to changes in programming paradigms, languages, and the complexity of software development. Popularized by the "Gang of Four" book in the early 1990s, classical design patterns were rooted in object-oriented programming principles (OOP). As the software industry has progressed, new programming paradigms, such as functional programming and reactive programming, have popularized, leading to the creation of patterns that match these paradigms. The rise of web development and the increase in the use of JavaScript has also influenced in the creation of patterns specifically to event-driven environments. 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In conclusion, design patterns stand as essentially required tools in the realm of coding, offering proven and reusable solutions to recurring challenges in software development. As evidenced by the evolution of design patterns over the years, they are dynamic entities, responsive to shifts in programming paradigms and languages. They serve as blueprints that can be adapted to specific situations, allowing developers to build upon the collective knowledge and experience of the software development community. Personally, I have used a lot of the Singleton pattern which ensures a class has only one instance, and the Module pattern, mentioned earlier in the Examples of Design Patterns section. These patterns contribute to the creation of a more understandable code, creating a shared vocabulary among developers and promoting efficiency in solving common design challenges.
