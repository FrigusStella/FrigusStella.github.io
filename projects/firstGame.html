<hr />

<p>Meteor is a very simplified game where there is a goal to collect as many coins as possible whilst dodging the falling meteors. Coins appear as small yellow dots, while the player is a blue dot. The game takes in use gravity mechanics and basic jumping. This all takes place in the middle of a “meteor shower”, where falling red balls of varrying sizes try to hit and kill the player. Collecting coins contributes to the score.. can you beat my score of 65?</p>

<p>While the game might not look like much, it was essentially the first game I had ever coded without help. The project itself was to be done in a whole 2 weeks, but besides the times I could work on it in class, there was not much time for me to work on it outside. Eventually, I ended up with only 1 day left and absolutely blasted through it. Although it was not considered a large project in our grade and the requirements were low, this is my proud achievement after only those couple weeks of learning Javascript.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>From this endeavor, I had learned (probably the most obvious thing) to not procrastinate on my coding projects/homework. Coding takes a lot of work and time, and when it comes to something like video game design that can be super engrossing, I would want to make sure I put my all into it. I wanted to work and expand more on this project, but did not have the time and eventually got to a point where I forgot the direction I was going. If there is something you want to accomplish, do it to your fullest potential.</p>
