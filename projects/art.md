<hr>
Get it? But for real, this is a block of old yugioh cards that were left unused and unwanted for the longest time in storage. While it may not be the most interesting thing, crafting something at least visually appealing from something collecting dust has always seemed fun, and this is my first one. Although, this is still in progress because I plan to make it life size... this is just one of the tens of smaller cubes I have.
<hr>
There is.. or was another larger cube made of pokemon cards, but it broke after some water damage and I never bothered to put it back together. Each one of the small boxes take no more than 4 minutes per, and for the cube shown in the picture, about an hour and a half.
<h3>Review</h3>
Why might I be doing this you might ask? Well to be honest, I was tired of not having something to do or to work on whilst relaxing or taking a break. As with origami, I have to be constantly patient and delicate in the construction. Also, having something large to work towards and finally seeing it all come together, literally, is satisfying enough.
