This project is the final result of a semester of learning C and C++. It is a project that challenged us to use objects and reading information from other files to securely store the information of the "Bank Customer" inside. It takes a account number and address for specific people and stores all the records in order of number.

This entire project was mostly done my myself, through just the instruction of what to do from the professor. 
<h3>Review</h3>
Creating this project in itself was a large task for me personally as coding on terminal did not allow for much speed when making an error, so it was a much more humbling experience and really put into perspective the value of going step by step and proper planning. Due to the project as a whole was split up into two parts, it became easier to pinpoint exactly what was wrong and where.
