Meteor is a very simplified game where there is a goal to collect as many coins as possible whilst dodging the falling meteors. Coins appear as small yellow dots, while the player is a blue dot. The game takes in use gravity mechanics and basic jumping. This all takes place in the middle of a "meteor shower", where falling red balls of varrying sizes try to hit and kill the player. Collecting coins contributes to the score.. can you beat my score of 65?

While the game might not look like much, it was essentially the first game I had ever coded without help. The project itself was to be done in a whole 2 weeks, but besides the times I could work on it in class, there was not much time for me to work on it outside. Eventually, I ended up with only 1 day left and absolutely blasted through it. Although it was not considered a large project in our grade and the requirements were low, this is my proud achievement after only those couple weeks of learning Javascript.

From this endeavor, I had learned (probably the most obvious thing) to not procrastinate on my coding projects/homework. Coding takes a lot of work and time, and when it comes to something like video game design that can be super engrossing, I would want to make sure I put my all into it. I wanted to work and expand more on this project, but did not have the time and eventually got to a point where I forgot the direction I was going. If there is something you want to accomplish, do it to your fullest potential.
